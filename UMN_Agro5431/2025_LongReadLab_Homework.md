Homework Questions
1.	How long is your longest read?
2.	DNA passes through the pore at 400 bases/second, how long did it take this read to traverse the pore?
3.	Perform an online nucleotide BLAST with one of your mapped reads
-What organism does it match?
-What is the length and identity of the match?
-What can you infer about the base-calling accuracy?
4.	You calculated the sum of the bases called - what coverage of the Setaria viridis genome is this?
Hint: it is possible that this is less than one, you'll need to search the S. viridis genome size
5.	How many total reads mapped to the Setaria genome?
6.	Some of our unmapped reads mapped to common bacteria -- name three potential sources of bacterial DNA in our sequencing library.
7.	In my full run, I generated 170 fast5s from my run.
If the read length for all fast5s is about equal to the mean of your subset, what depth coverage of Setaria did I get from this single MinIon flowcell?
8.	Using R or Excel (or any other tool) generate boxplots that show the distribution of fastq lengths from each of your 11 fast5s. Note: this means you will have 11 bars.
-Include a text label indicating the mean read length for each fastq and remember to label your axes
