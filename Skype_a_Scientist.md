# Skype-a-Scientist - Jan 2022

A seventh grade class watched segments of this YouTube video about rapid ohia death: \
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MISAKT4LgFw \
the most "science-y" segments:  4:37-12:12 and 16:45 to 21:15

The class is doing a project on native plants in Southern California.

Each student wrote a question based on the video - we met for ~ 45 minutes and I presented \
some background material about me and plant disease

If/when I do it again, I will try to receive questions ahead of time and integrate them into my presentation, \
but overall I thought it went pretty well.
